OUTLINE:
This is a version of my group's capstone project for the Cleveland Codes Software Developer's Academy
at Cuyahoga Community College. This new version contains updates to the theme (page layout and color 
palette), product page filters, product page pagination, employee home view, and image formats.  

The project utilizes web2py (http://www.web2py.com/), an MVC framework.  

It is a CRM for a food distribution company.  Through role-based access control, 
employees are given access to only parts of the system that they need.  I have built 
out a product page with filters that can be applied in various combinations.  The filters make server calls and return
paginated results.


Tasks for employees include:
- CRUD for Companies, the contact person, and notes on those relationships
- Managers can modify data related of their reports
- The CEO can see everything and how the data relates to all of their employees, they can also update the food catalog
- The Database Admin has access to all of the information, and they are the only ones that can modify User accounts

FUNCTIONALITY TO ADD (post Cleveland Codes):
- Order management system (incoming and outgoing)
- ~~Individual view pages for the catalog~~
- ~~more sorting options / search for the catalog~~
- A way for customers to submit orders on their own
- Styles for more viewport sizes
