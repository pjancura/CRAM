It runs slow because it was deployed utilizing a free account. 

OUTLINE:
This is the version of my capstone project.  
It was built for the Cleveland Codes Software Developer's Academy at Cuyahoga Community College.

The project utilizes web2py (http://www.web2py.com/), an MVC framework.  

It is a CRM for a food distribution company.  Through role-based access control, 
employees are given access to only parts of the system that they need.  I have built 
out a catalog page that with filters that can be applied.  The filters make server calls to return
paginated results.


Tasks for employees include:
- CRUD for Companies, the contact person, and notes on those relationships
- Managers can modify data related of their reports
- The CEO can see everything and how the data relates to all of their employees, they can also update the food catalog
- The Database Admin has access to all of the information, and they are the only ones that can modify User accounts

FUNCTIONALITY TO ADD:
- Order management system (incoming and outgoing)
- ~~Individual view pages for the catalog~~
- ~~more sorting options / search for the catalog~~
- A way for customers to submit orders on their own
- Styles for more viewport sizes
